        		<h1>About Me</h1>

style="width: 300px;"/> 
				<p>I am a Fellow in Governance Studies at the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/experts/katharine-meyer/">Brookings Institution</a>. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research associate at the <a href="https://www.annenberginstitute.org/">Annenberg Institute 
					at Brown University</a> and research affiliate at the <a href="https://nudge4.org/">Nudge4Solutions Lab 
					at the University of Virginia</a>. I am a higher education policy scholar with a quantitative methodological 
					focus grounded in econometrics and behavioral science. My work focuses on how individuals access knowledge needed 
					to make informed decisions about their postsecondary education opportunities – and how to build successful, 
					scalable strategies to ensure greater access to that information. 
					In my job market paper, "<a href="https://edworkingpapers.com/sites/default/files/ai20-317.pdf">Stacking the Deck for Employment Success: The Labor Market Returns to Stackable Credentials </a>,” 
					I document the causal effect of students earning multiple community college credentials in a career ladder – 
					“stacking” some combination of certificates or applied associates degrees. 
					Other ongoing work explores the effects of school counselors on student take-up of financial aid programs, 
					the administrative burden of free college programs and potential for behaviorally informed solution to mitigate burden, 
					and how variance in student/advisor interactions affect treatment response. Outside of higher education, I apply behavioral science 
					insights to improve youth library access, increase virtual school engagement, and encourage SNAP recertification.
					My work has been published in journals such as the <i>Journal of Policy Analysis 
					and Management</i>, <i>Daedalus</i>, and <i>Journal of Human Resources</i>.
