        		<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I am a postdoctoral research associate at the <a href="https://www.annenberginstitute.org/">Annenberg Institute 
					at Brown University</a> with a joint appointment at the <a href="https://nudge4.org/">Nudge4Solutions Lab 
					at the University of Virginia</a>. My primary line of research focuses on the application of 
					behavioral science insights to develop and evaluate interventions helping students and 
					families navigate complex education investment decisions. 
					My current experimental work includes projects targeting preschool attendance, 
					library engagement, financial aid filing, and college persistence. 
					My non-experimental work includes projects on the effects of school counselors 
					on student outcomes and the returns to community college enrollment. 
					My work has been published in journals such as the Journal of Policy Analysis 
					and Management, Daedalus, and the Journal of Student Financial Aid.
